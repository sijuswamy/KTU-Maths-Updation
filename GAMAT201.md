## Suggestions for Course Delivery

Introduce the concept of matrix and its applications through an excel sheet structure. It is better to create a Google form and give the students to fill out the forms with the basic details like- Name, Age, Gender, marks in Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics and expectation about the course. Introduce the concept of dataset, features (columns), samples / vectors as (rows). Various data types like name as string, age as numerical variable, gender as categorical variable etc., Presense of non numerical columns demands transformations from character/ string to numerical values. In essence the students should get the concept that matrix is both a data representation and analytics tool.

- Introduce the system of linear equations using a simple linear equation in two space- eg., $$2x+y=11; 2x-y=10.$$
Solve these equations in both algebraic and geometric methods (use Desmos or Cocalc). Explore the fact that the *determinant* of the coefficents of the system determine whether the lines are parallel or not.
- Representation of the linear system as linear combination of column vectors with unknowns as coefficients- for example the above system can be represented as \[x \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\  2\end{bmatrix}\]
- Introduce the precedure for solving a system of linear equations using Gauss elimination method.
- Present the linear system $$2x+y=11; 4x+2y=10.$$ and try to solve
