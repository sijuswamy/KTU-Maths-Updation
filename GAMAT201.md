## Suggestions for Course Delivery

Introduce the concept of matrix and its applications through an excel sheet structure. It is better to create a Google form and give the students to fill out the forms with the basic details like- Name, Age, Gender, marks in Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics and expectation about the course. Introduce the concept of dataset, features (columns), samples / vectors as (rows). Various data types like name as string, age as numerical variable, gender as categorical variable etc., Presense of non numerical columns demands transformations from character/ string to numerical values. In essence the students should get the concept that matrix is both a data representation and analytics tool.

- Introduce the system of linear equations using a simple linear equation in two space- eg., $$2x+y=11; 2x-y=10.$$
Solve these equations in both algebraic and geometric methods (use Desmos or Cocalc). Explore the fact that the *determinant* of the coefficents of the system determine whether the lines are parallel or not.
- Representation of the linear system as linear combination of column vectors with unknowns as coefficients- for example the above system can be represented as

 $$
x\begin{pmatrix}
2\\
2
\end{pmatrix}+y
\begin{pmatrix}
1\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
11\\
10\end{pmatrix}
$$

- Introduce the precedure for solving a system of linear equations using Gauss elimination method.
- Present the linear system $$2x+y=11; 4x+2y=10.$$ and try to solve it using Gauss elimination method. Demonstrate the fact that the solution leads to a mathematical falaci. This will leads to frame a systematic method to check consistency of the system. Now introduce the concept of rank as number of linearly independent rows.
- Present the row reduced echelon form form to find rank of a matrix.
- Introduce the concept of vector space/ linear space- using the $\mathbb{R^2}$ as an example. (include 3b1b video link)
- Explain the connection between geometry and algebra by representing  $a\hat{i}+b\hat{j}+c\hat{k}$  
  $\begin{pmatrix} a\\ b\\ c\end{pmatrix}$
- IntrodSpaning set, maximally independent spanning set (basis)
