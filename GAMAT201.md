**Knowledge Category:** Procedure and Modelling

**Expected Affective Domain Level:**- Appreciate the Mathematical Background of Linear systems

## Suggestions for Course Delivery

Introduce the concept of matrix and its applications through an excel sheet structure. It is better to create a Google form and give the students to fill out the forms with the basic details like- Name, Age, Gender, marks in Physics, Chemistry & Mathematics and expectation about the course. Introduce the concept of dataset, features (columns), samples / vectors as (rows). Various data types like name as string, age as numerical variable, gender as categorical variable etc., Presense of non numerical columns demands transformations from character/ string to numerical values. In essence the students should get the concept that matrix is both a data representation and analytics tool.

- Introduce the system of linear equations using a simple linear equation in two space- eg., $$2x+y=11; 2x-y=10$$
