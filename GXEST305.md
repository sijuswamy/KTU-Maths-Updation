## Module-1 Introduction to AI and Machine Learning
Basics of Machine Learning - types of Machine Learning systems-challenges in ML- Supervised learning model example- regression models- Classification model example- Logistic regression-unsupervised model example- K-means clustering. Artificial Neural Network- Perceptron- Universal Approximation Theorem (statement only)- Multi-Layer Perceptron- Deep Neural Network- demonstration of regression and classification problems using MLP.

- Introduce the concept of machine learning with proper example and illustrations
- Explain different types of machine learning- Supervised, unsupervised and Reinforcement learning with proper contexts (Use branch specific examples).
- Introduce linear regression as an example of supervised learning technique- use statistical or least square method to find the coefficients in the linear legression equation, $y=\beta_0+\bata_! x$ ( Use microsoft excel utility for demonstration).
- Introduce the concept of classification with a simple example where the output variable takes only two values- $0$ and $1$. First try the regression, then explain the inappropriateness of the regression model with some predictions based on the model. Demonstrate the sigmoid function- $\sigma(x)=\dfrac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$ where $z=\beta_0+\beta_1 x$. Explain the concept of logit function and its role in converting continuous variable to probability measure.
- Introduce the concept of clustering as an unsupervised learning method using the `iris` dataset.
