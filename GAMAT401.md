## $\color{red}{\text{Instructional Design for Teaching Graph Theory}}$

## Theme
The instructional design for teaching graph theory to computer science engineering students aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both abstract and practical aspects of graph theory. Each concept will be introduced with an example, followed by abstraction, practice problems (both theoretical and applied), and computational implementation. This approach ensures that students grasp the theoretical underpinnings and develop algorithmic thinking and computational skills essential for their professional growth.

## Teaching Paradigm
### Abstract and Practical Viewpoints
Graph theory concepts are presented in a manner that balances abstract mathematical foundations with practical applications. This dual approach helps students understand the relevance of graph theory in solving real-world problems.

### Example-Driven Learning
Each concept is introduced with a concrete example to help students visualize and understand the idea before diving into formal definitions and theoretical aspects. This contextual learning aids in better comprehension and retention.

### Abstraction
Following the example, the concept is abstracted into formal mathematical definitions and properties. This step solidifies the students' understanding and prepares them for more complex applications and problems.

### Practice Problems
#### Formative Assessments (Pen and Paper)
Students practice abstract and application-level problems using traditional methods, focusing on formative assessments to reinforce learning. This step includes drawing graphs, identifying properties, and solving theoretical problems.

#### Computational Approach (Algorithmic Thinking)
Students implement the concepts in Python, developing their computational and algorithmic thinking skills. This hands-on practice bridges the gap between theory and practical application, preparing students for real-world challenges.
