# Module-1
- Introduce the concept of rate of cahange with *physical examples* like velocity, acceleration etc.
- Visualize the rate of change - first order (velocity), curvature, second order( accelaration) etc., Use Geogebra/ Cocalc etc.
- Demonstrate derivative as a limiting function- $f(x)=x^2$ about points $0$ and $3$.
- Demonstrate the the linear approximation through demonstaration of $f(x)=x^3+2x+5$ about $x=5$. Compare linear approximations using univariate Taylor series of $f(x)=e^x,f(x)=\sinx 
- Demonstrate the concave and convex functions in two/three dimensions.

# Module-2

- Introduce the Graphs, level curves and contour of functions through examples like $f(x)=x^2+y^2,f(x)=x^2-5y^2, f(x,y)=\dfrac{xy}{x^2+y^2}$ using Geogebra or Cocalc.
- Limit of multivariable functions as extension of single variable limit- Better to demonstrate the multivariate limits of functions like- $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.
- Continuity of functions can be demonstrated using simple bi-variate function. Discontinuity points will be termed as holes in plane.
- Demonstrate the partial derivative as reate of change of one variable keeping other variable as constant. Better to introduce the possibility of vector representation of partial derivative.
- Higher order partial derivatives and its uses in Computational Modelling.

# Module-3

- Representation of composition of functions- using  simple functions like $f(x)=x^2, g(x)=\sin(x), f\circ g=\sin(x^2)$. Demonstrate the impact of change in input variable $x$ on $f(x),g(x)$ and $f\circ g$- Represent this change in composition function using chain rule.
- Gradient as the vector form of derivative of multi-variable functions.
- Demonstrate that the gradient at point is normal to the tangent plane.
- Directional derivative as impact of change in one variable on another function with reference to direction of other function.
- Introduce the concept of un-constrained optimization in calculus approach- extension of second derivative test to muti-variable calculus.
- Introduce the relative maxima and relative minima as local maxima and maxima with proper examles like hills and valleys in in Geoearth ore other simple examples.
- Demonstrate the local extrema and global extrema using suitable functions.

# Module-4

- Introduce the the concept of constrained optimization as the diffusion of constraint to the objective function using elimination of variable technique. eg. $f(x)=x^2+y^2$ subject to the constrains $g(x,y)=x+y-1$.
- Introduce the concept of Lagrange multiplier as combining constraints with objective function.
- Explain equvalence of solution obtained through both the methods.
- introduce the concept of iterative minimization through Steepest descend and demonstrate the steepest descend approach in the solution of $f(x)=x^2$ at $x=0$.
- Introduce the mathematical modelling of LPP using real world problem
- Give more importannce to the solution space, feasible solution and the simplex procedure to find optimal solution of the objective function.
